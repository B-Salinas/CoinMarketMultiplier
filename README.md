# Coin Market Multiplier

The idea is simple. 

Take any coin (token, stablecoin, or memecoin), your entry point into its market, number of coins held (and future coins bought), current market cap and volume, and we can ~ PREDICT ~ potential multipliers. 

Hopefully this works out.

The focus of this project is to help my understanding of buying/selling/holding crypto. The markets move fast and I want to better understand how all these variables influence each other.
